Jinx provides just-in-time spell-checking via [[https://abiword.github.io/enchant/][libenchant]]. The package aims to
achieve high performance and low resource usage, without impacting your editing
experience. Overall Jinx should just work out of the box without much
intervention.

Jinx highlights misspellings lazily only in the visible part of the text. The
window boundaries and text folding are taken into account. Jinx binds directly
to the native libenchant API, such that process communication with a backend
Aspell process can be avoided. Libenchant is widely used as spell-checking API
by text editors and supports [[https://nuspell.github.io/][Nuspell]], [[http://hunspell.github.io/][Hunspell]], [[http://aspell.net/][Aspell]] and a few lesser known
backends. Jinx automatically compiles and loads the native module at startup.

Jinx supports multiple languages in a buffer at the same time via the
=jinx-languages= customization variable. It offers flexible settings to ignore
misspellings via faces (=jinx-exclude-faces= and =jinx-include-faces=), regular
expressions (=jinx-exclude-regexps=) and programmable predicates. Jinx comes
preconfigured for the most important major modes.

* Installation

The package is available on GNU ELPA and MELPA and can be installed with
=package-install=. Libenchant must be installed on your system for compilation. If
=pkg-config= is available it will be used to locate libenchant. On Debian or
Ubuntu, install the packages =libenchant-2-2=, =libenchant-2-dev= and =pkg-config=.

* Usage

Jinx offers three auto-loaded entry points , the modes =global-jinx-mode=,
=jinx-mode= and the command =jinx-correct=. You can either enable =global-jinx-mode=
or add =jinx-mode= to the hooks of the modes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook #'global-jinx-mode)

  (dolist (hook '(text-mode-hook prog-mode-hook conf-mode-hook))
    (add-hook hook #'jinx-mode))
#+end_src

In order to correct misspellings bind =jinx-correct= to a convenient key in your
configuration. Jinx is independent of the Ispell package, so you can reuse the
binding =M-$= which is bound to =ispell-word= by default. When pressing =M-$=, Jinx
offers correction suggestions for the misspelling next to point. If the prefix
key =C-u= is pressed, the entire buffer is spell-checked.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (keymap-global-set "<remap> <ispell-word>" #'jinx-correct)
#+end_src

* Alternatives

- [[https://github.com/astoff/jit-spell][jit-spell]]: Jinx offers a similar UI as Augusto Stoffel's jit-spell package and
  borrows ideas from it. Jit-spell uses Ispell process communication instead of
  a native API. It does not restrict the highlighting to the visible text. In my
  setup I observed an increase in load and latency as a consequence, in
  particular in combination with stealth locking and commands which trigger
  fontification eagerly like =consult-line= from my [[https://github.com/minad/consult][Consult]] package.

- [[https://codeberg.org/ideasman42/emacs-spell-fu][spell-fu]]: The technique to spell-check only the visible text was inspired by
  Campbell Barton's spell-fu package. Spell-fu maintains the dictionary itself
  via a hash table, which results in high memory usage for languages with
  compound words or inflected word forms. In Jinx we avoid the complexity of
  managing the dictionary and access the advanced spell-checker algorithms
  directly via libenchant (affixation, compound words, etc.).
