* Development

- Add =jinx-languages= command to switch languages locally or globally.
- =jinx-correct=: When checking the whole buffer via =C-u M-$=, don't restore
  original point position upon =C-g= to ease cursory edits. Instead push a mark
  which can be used to go back to the original position.
- Add =jinx-mode-map= to make it easy to bind keys if =jinx-mode= is enabled. The
  map is empty by default.
- Ignore single quotes and apostrophes at the beginning and end of words. Please
  provide feedback if this is a reasonable approach.
- Support spell checking of camelCased words via the =jinx-camel-modes= variable.

* Version 0.4 (2023-03-27)

- =jinx-languages=: Fall back to =$LANG= environment variable, since
  =current-locale-environment= is an Emacs 29 addition.
- =jinx--mod-wordchars=: Handle non-UTF8 return values gracefully.
- =jinx-correct=: Always start from nearest overlay.
- =jinx-misspelled=: Use less obtrusive color for the underlining.

* Version 0.3 (2023-03-27)

- Add =jinx-misspelled-map=.
- =jinx-correct=: Unfold invisible line when correcting misspellings.
- =jinx-correct=: Show number of misspellings.
- Add =emacs-module.h= to avoid compilation problems.
- =jinx-languages=: Use =current-locale-environment= by default.

* Version 0.2 (2023-03-26)

- Start of changelog.
